data_manipulator::process_raw_json_array()
Look into fixing the incorrect RSS feeds in the crawl/a better way of detecting and repairing them.
Verify the 'http://www.' and '/' concatenation works.

Potentially unnecessary:
data_manipulator::process_raw_json_array() -> attaching crawl date
	Removed for now, see if affects.
data_manipulator::create_post_from_rss() -> CDATA stripping.
